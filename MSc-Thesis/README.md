# LTeX – LanguageTool grammar/spell checking

[LTeX](LTeX – LanguageTool grammar/spell checking) is an extension for Visual Studio Code. It finds grammar ans spelling issues and proposes fixes.

# grammar/spell check using Microsoft Word

LTeX finds a lot of mistakes but not all. Combining it with the grammar/spell checker of Microsoft Word finds most of your mistakes. Open the generated PDF in word and trigger a check to get a list of issues.
